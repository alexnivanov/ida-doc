# How to use the app

## Map

Use buttons on the bottom to search for Places, Events & People.
Use the Radar button (bottom left) to scan area for existing objects.
To create Place or Event, long tap on the map until red marker appears, then tap it again. Notice "Visible to all" switch: if it's on, new object is visible for all users of the app! It's good for public places like playground, but doesn't suite private homes.

You can also use Plus button (bottom of the map) to create Places, Events and Movements.

## Communities

Connect with people in your area using various interests! You'll get notified when there are new interests in your area. If you add new interest, people around will get notified as well!

## More

# Good to know

You can invite Contacts to Places, Events and Movements, chat with them and receive auto check-in notifications.

# Privacy

Your location is shared with Communities, Groups and Users of your choice. If you are participating in a Movement, your location is shared with all participants.
